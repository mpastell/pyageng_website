     Why do we measure things?
    </a>
   </h2>
   <p>
    Measurements form the basis of empirical research.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    The purpose of
measurements are usually divided in the following three categories:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Observe a process
     </strong>
     : Home temperature, electricity
consumption, water consumption, CO level in garage, medical
diagnostics.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     Not actually research and not (at least automatic)
control.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Research
     </strong>
     : Test theories with measurements (testing a model
for plant growth), create experimental models for a relationship
between factors for phenomena with no existing theory (predict
cattle lameness based on weight distribution during milking).
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Control
     </strong>
     : we want to automatically control a process given
certain parameters.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     e.g.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     control the fan speed and inlet openings of
a barn based on temperature and
     <span class="inline_math">
      \( CO_2  \)
     </span>
     measurements.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <em>
     Fault diagnostics
    </em>
    is one popular application of measurements based
on observing a process.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    A machine, animal or a plant is monitored with a
sensor and model predicts when there is a failure or disease.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    E.g the
lameness in cattle can be predicted using force sensors, pig cough can
be measured using sound analysis and bearing failure in machinery can
predicted based on resonance frequency.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    The models used to predict
problems can be very simple based on limit values or more complex models
that are fitted to data based on sample dataset(This is called machine
learning).
   </p>
   <p>
    The objectives can also overlap e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    we may want to also research the
process we are controlling.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    The purpose of the measurement affects its
requirements for accuracy and reliability.

    <p>
     Plan the measurements carefully.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     Incomplete planning will compromise the
whole study.
     <span class="intersentencespace">

     Ask the following questions when planning:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      What things affect the measured quantity?
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
      Can you measure or control
these variables?
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      What is the rate of change of the measured phenomenon?
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
      What is the
suitable sampling rate?
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      What is the required accuracy and precision of the measurement?
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
      This
together with the sampling rate will determine the needed
measurement system.
      <span class="intersentencespace">

     <li>
      How are you going to store the data?

     Sensor

    is a transducer that convert a physical quantity to a
measurable analog signal.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     ADC
    </strong>
    (analog-to-digital converter) converts the analog signal to digital
   </p>
   <p>
    A
    <strong>
     computer/datalogger/microcontroller
    </strong>
    is used to store and display the
information.
   </p>
   <p>
    The wires from sensor to ADC should be as short as possible to minimize
noise and level changes.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Voltage signals suffer from voltage drop when
long wires are used due to the resistance of the circuit.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Current
signals however are a lot less sensitive to interference and donâ€™t have
a problem with level changes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Digital signals can be transmitted without a loss of information with efficient
compression (e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    using the Internet) and are therefore the preferred method for
transmitting data.

    A signal is a description of how one parameter relates to another.

    Usually signals are measured as a function of time e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">

      Analog signals
     </strong>
     : (voltage, current) take continuous range of values.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     Most real world signals are continuous.

     <li>
      Commonly used analog signals are voltage signals (0-10V, 0-5V etc.)

     <strong>
      Digital signals
     </strong>
     are discrete, they can only take limited range of values and are
sampled at a certain interval.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     With
     <strong>
      proper sampling
     </strong>
     the digital signal can
represent all the information present in the original analog signal.
    </p>
    <p>
     The quality of the sample depends on the
     <strong>
      accuracy of the AD
conversion
     </strong>
     and the
     <strong>
      sampling rate
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Computers can only work with digital signals and they have numerous
advantages over analog signals:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      They can be compressed efficiently
     </li>
     <li>
      Efficient storage and data transfer
     </li>
     <li>
      Several digital signals can be transmitted in the same wire or
radio channel.
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
     </li>
     <li>
      Digital signal processing allows the use of more sophisticated
filters.
      <span class="intersentencespace">
      </span>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Some digital signals such as the one in USB cable are still voltage
signals, but they only take two levels representing binary values 0
and 1.

     Analog to digital conversion

   </h2>
   <p>
    Analog-to-digital converterss (
    <strong>
     ADC
    </strong>
    ) work by taking a sample of the original
signal and comparing it to a fixed number of known voltage levels.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    The signal is then
rounded to the closest reference level.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    The resolution of the ADC is
given in bits which means that the number of values the digitize
signal can get, for
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( n \)
    </span>
    bit ADC is
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( 2^n \)
    </span>
    .
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Each ADC works for a certain
voltage range e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    0 â€“ 5 V.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Taking a sample of analog signal for digitization is called the
sample-and-hold method.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     Analog signal is rounded to the nearest possible value.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     The
difference between the original value and the digitized sample is
called
     <strong>
      quantization error
     </strong>
     .
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     The difference between adjacent conversion levels is
called
     <strong>
      least significant bit (LSB)
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
     The maximum quantization error is therefore
     <span class="inline_math">
      \(  \pm\frac{1}{2}  \)
     </span>
     LSB.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Suppose we have an 8bit ADC with the range of
0-5V. It can produce
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( 2^8 = 256  \)
    </span>
    distinct numbers (0-255) so
with the range of 5V its voltage
    <strong>
     resolution
    </strong>
    is 5/256
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( \approx  \)
    </span>
    20
mV. This value is also called
    <strong>
     LSB
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    This means in practice that when digitized analog values 10 â€“ 30 mV
are rounded to 20mV and analog values 30 â€“ 50 mV to 40mV etc.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    The
    <strong>
     quantization
    </strong>
    error for analog value 10mV is 20mV - 10mV =
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( \frac{1}{2}  \)
    </span>
    LSB.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now if you have a temperature sensor with the sensitivity of
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( \frac{10mV}{^{\circ}C}  \)
    </span>
    .
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    then digitization introduces an
error of
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( \pm 1^{\circ}C  \)
    </span>
    to the measurement.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    If you want to increase the
    <em>
     precision
    </em>
    of your measurement you need to use an ADC with
higher
    <em>
     resolution
    </em>
    .
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    This still doesnâ€™t guarantee that the measurements
will be

     Sampling
    </a>
   </h2>
   <p>
    In addition to getting accurate samples of the voltage we also need to
consider the rate of change of the signal.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Here are two definitions that
help us decide how often we need to sample:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     The sampling theorem
    </strong>
    A continuous signal can be properly sampled, only if it does not
contain frequency components above one-half of the sampling
rate.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    <em>
     (Nyquist criterion, Nyquist-Shannon theorem)
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Proper sampling
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    If you can reconstruct the analog signal from samples, you must
have done the sampling correctly.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    (Smith 1997).
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that the highest frequency of interest in a signal is easy to define
for periodic signals (
    <em>
     waveforms with recurring frequencies.
    </em>
    ).
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    For other signals
we need to consider how can we reliably measure the fastest peaks e.g for force
measurements and ECG (electrocardiograph) signals.
   </p>
   <p>
    In practice we usually do not know what is the highest frequency is,
and we need to find out:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A practical way is to sample as fast as you can and determine the
required sample rate from the data.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Choosing an appropriate sample rate is also important because using too high
sample rate increases the need for data storage, power
consumption (especially a concern with wireless devices), analysis
time etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Signals are often shown in figures as continuous lines because when
there are many samples in a figure using a symbol for each sample makes
the plot look messy like in
    <a class="hyperref" href="sampling.html#fig-jump">
     Figure
     <span class="ref">
      1.2
     </span>
    </a>
    B. It is however
important to remember that lines are not actual measured values and just
used to connect the dots (if we give each point in a line a value it is
called linear interpolation).
   </p>
   <p>
    If you are plotting the data to inspect if you have sampled often enough
it is a good idea to use a symbol to represent each point and leave the
lines out.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Also make sure you zoom close enough to the closest peaks so
you can really tell how far apart successive samples are.

     Measurements systems generally have noise, fluctuation around the true
value.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     If you only take one sample every 15 minutes the noise level will
go unnoticed, however when you take several samples from a sensor at
moderately high sample (e.g.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     10Hz) there is likely some variability in
the values.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     Although if the noise level in the system is lower than the
resolution of your ADC it will be hidden.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     You can analyze the amount of
noise in your system using statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quantization error is also random noise with a standard deviation of
     <span class="inline_math">
      \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}  \)
     </span>
     LSB. This is usually a small
addition to the noise already present in the measured analog signal.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that random noise has a Gaussian distribution means that the
the most probable value of the signal is the average value and the
standard deviation gives us a meaningful estimate of the variability.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the signal is stationary during repeated measurements you can make
the measured value more precise by taking several samples and averaging.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     If the signal is not stationary, but the noise is random you can use a
moving average filter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note that you should check whether or not the noise is Gaussian before
you do this.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     If the signal is not Gaussian then you should check whether
the variability in the signal is due to interference and whether or not
you can get rid off it by improving the measurement
set up or filtering the signal.

      Accuracy and precision

    </h3>
    <p>
     Suppose you take several static measurements from in a short period of
time e.g.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     measure the weight of a cow several times in a row then:
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Accuracy
     </strong>
     is the difference between the average measured value and correct
value.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     (=
     <strong>
      bias
     </strong>
     )
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Precision
     </strong>
     is the variation between the samples i.e.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     the repeatability of the measurement.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     It is measured with standard deviation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Accuracy is a measure of systematic error and precision is a measure
of random noise and can be improved using calibration.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
     Precision can be
improved by taking more measurements and averaging or in many cases improving the
measurement set up.
    </p>

     Calibration
    </a>
   </h2>
   <p>
    In calibration the measured value is compared to the true value (or
more accurate value obtained from better instrument or lab
analysis).
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Results are used to calculate
     <em>
      calibration coefficients
     </em>
     .

     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     Is used to correct systematic error in the measurements.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
    <li>
     Itâ€™s important to have enough calibration points, especially if the
sensors response curve is not linear.
     <span class="intersentencespace">
     </span>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    It usually helps if you know physics you e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    use a known mass to
calibrate force sensors, rotary movement with known radius to calibrate
accelerometers, boiling water and ice to calibrate temperature sensors
etc.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Calibration also needs to be checked during long running
measurements because the properties of the sensors or system can change
over time.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Sensors in tough environments such as cattle buildings or
field are especially prone to changes in calibration.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some instruments have calibration certificates from the manufacturer.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    There are specialized calibration labs to do the calibration for you.

    <strong>
     Span
    </strong>
    : This is the measurement range of an instrument e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    0-5 V, -10 â€“
10V.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Drift:
    </strong>
    is the change of the zero level of a measurement over time.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    Drifting
can occur e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    due to temperature when the properties of the amplifiers or
sensors change.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Sensitivity
    </strong>
    is the change in output of the sensor relative to the input: 10
    <span class="inline_math">
     \( \frac{mV}{^o C}  \)
    </span>
    ,

    <strong>
     Resolution
    </strong>
    tells how accurately a quantity can be measured with a sensor or a
system.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    For ADCs the resolution is expressed in bits and you can calculate the voltage
resolution.
    <span class="intersentencespace">
    </span>
    For sensors this is usually indicated in the measured unit e.g.
    <span class="intersentencespace">

    <span class="inline_math">
     \( \pm 0.1 ^{\circ}  \)

     With the recommended input voltage 10V the sensitivity is
20mV/500 kg, which means that if we want to measure force
with 1 kg resolution we need to be able to measure voltage
with 0.04 mV resolution.
